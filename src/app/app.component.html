<h1>Angular 18 Essentials</h1>

<h2>Handling User Interaction</h2>

<h3>keyup and keydown</h3>

<input (keydown)="onKeydown($event)" (keyup)="onKeyup($event)">

<p>Pressed {{pressed}}</p>

<p>Released {{released}}</p>

<strong>If you need to access the event object, Angular provides an implicit $event variable that you can pass to a
    function: (click)="createUser($event)"</strong>
